_Welcome._  
I work as a Data & Research Analyst out of Portland, Oregon, U.S. I specialize in Geographic Information Science (GIS) and aspire to apply my analytical skills in finding solutions to social and ecological issues.

When i'm not geeking out I like to write and perform music, dream about traveling with my partner, and get some quality time in with family and friends.
