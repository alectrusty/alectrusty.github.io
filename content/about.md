## who am I?
My name is Alec Trusty. On paper, I'm a geographer with some tech skills. 
In real life, I'm a simple Oregonian who loves his fiance and a good adventure. If you'd like to chat,
feel free to contact me at any one of the provided links on my [contact](https://github.com/alectrusty) page.
