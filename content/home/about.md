## Hi, I'm Alec.

A a geographer and environmental scientist by training, I aspire to elevate my skillset in predictive analytics to develop insights into socio-ecological issues and build useful data-driven tools. Thus, I consider myself an environmental data scientist in training. I have over two years of project-based experience with the [Center for Spatial Analysis & Research](https://www.pdx.edu/geography/center-for-spatial-analysis-research-csar) and the [Sustaining Urban Places Research Lab](http://www.suprlab.org/), and have worked on several projects as a freelancer. I'm currently offering a variety of GIS & data services as an independent contractor, so please feel free to contact me if you feel my skillset could help you achieve your goals.
