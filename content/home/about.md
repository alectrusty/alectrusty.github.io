## Hi, I'm Alec.

I consider myself an Environmental Data Scientist in training, but I have over two years of project-based experience with the [Center for Spatial Analysis & Research](https://www.pdx.edu/geography/center-for-spatial-analysis-research-csar) and the [Sustaining Urban Places Research Lab](http://www.suprlab.org/). I'm currently offering GIS & data services as an independent contractor.
