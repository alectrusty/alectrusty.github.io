I work as a Data & Research Analyst out of Portland, Oregon, U.S. My specialty is in Geographic Information Science (GIS) and aspire to apply my analytical skills in finding solutions to social and ecological issues.

When i'm not geeking out I like to write and perform music, dream about traveling with my partner, and get some quality time in with family and friends.
